The performance of Belief Propagation (BP) decoding algorithms is often challenged in noisy communication channels. This research proposes the integration of an undercomplete convolutional autoencoder at the receiver to mitigate noise in Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) received over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, prior to BP decoding. Utilizing synthetically generated LLRs for specified parity-check matrices (H) and small code sizes, the study demonstrates that this autoencoder-based noise reduction significantly improves Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. These findings are particularly relevant for long-distance or deep-space communication scenarios where high decoding accuracy is critical, even if it entails a potential increase in processing latency.
