    * Suggest directions for future research, such as:
        * Optimizing the autoencoder's complexity and architecture for potential latency reduction or real-time deployment.
        * Exploring the impact of different channel models (e.g., fading channels) on the autoencoder's performance.
        * Investigating the scalability to larger code sizes.
        * Considering end-to-end learning approaches that might jointly optimize the autoencoder and BP.
        * **Further analysis of the latency implications** and potential hardware acceleration for practical deployment in space applications.
