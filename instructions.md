## Formal Description of the Research

This research investigates the enhancement of belief propagation (BP) algorithm performance through the integration of an **undercomplete convolutional autoencoder**. Specifically, the autoencoder will be deployed at the receiver side, operating on the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) immediately following channel reception over an **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel**, and prior to their input into the BP decoder. The primary function of this autoencoder will be to mitigate noise present in the received LLRs, thereby acting as a noise reduction mechanism to **significantly improve the overall Bit Error Rate (BER) performance** of the belief propagation algorithm. This approach is particularly relevant for scenarios demanding extremely robust communication, such as **long-distance or deep-space communication**, where even small improvements in decoding accuracy are critical, acknowledging a potential increase in processing latency.
