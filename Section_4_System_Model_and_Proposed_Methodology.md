### 4.1 Communication System Model

The end-to-end communication system model considered in this research is depicted in Figure 4.1 (placeholder for a figure).
1.  **Source:** A binary data source generates sequences of bits, $u = (u_1, u_2, ..., u_K)$, where $K$ is the number of information bits. For simulation purposes, these bits are typically assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
2.  **Channel Encoder:** The information bits $u$ are encoded by a channel encoder, typically a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder defined by a parity-check matrix $H$, producing a codeword $c = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_N)$ of length $N$. The code rate is $R = K/N$.
3.  **Modulation:** The codeword bits $c$ are modulated using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), where bit $c_i=0$ is mapped to $s_i = +1$ and bit $c_i=1$ is mapped to $s_i = -1$.
4.  **Channel:** The modulated signal $s$ is transmitted over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. The received signal $y_i$ corresponding to $s_i$ is given by $y_i = s_i + n_i$, where $n_i$ are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2 = N_0/2$. $N_0$ is the single-sided power spectral density of the noise.
5.  **Receiver Architecture:**
    *   **LLR Calculation:** The receiver first calculates the Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) for each received symbol. For BPSK modulation over an AWGN channel, the LLR for the $i$-th bit $c_i$ is $L(c_i) = \log \frac{P(c_i=0|y_i)}{P(c_i=1|y_i)} = \frac{2y_i}{\sigma^2}$. Let this initial noisy LLR vector be $L_{noisy} = (L(c_1), ..., L(c_N))$.
    *   **Undercomplete Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE):** The noisy LLR vector $L_{noisy}$ is then processed by the proposed undercomplete CAE, which outputs a denoised LLR vector $L_{denoised}$. This is the core of our proposed methodology.
    *   **BP Decoder:** The denoised LLR vector $L_{denoised}$ is then fed into a BP decoder.
    *   **Demodulation & Sink:** The output of the BP decoder (estimated codeword bits) is then used to estimate the original information bits $\hat{u}$.

### 4.2 Belief Propagation Decoder

The BP decoder employed in this research is a standard sum-product algorithm operating on the factor graph defined by the parity-check matrix $H$ of the LDPC code. The decoder takes the (potentially denoised) LLRs as input. It iteratively updates messages between variable nodes and check nodes for a fixed number of iterations, $I_{max}$, or until a stopping criterion (e.g., all parity checks satisfied) is met. The specific update rules are:
*   **Variable-to-Check Message Update:** (Placeholder for equation)
*   **Check-to-Variable Message Update:** (Placeholder for equation)
The initial LLR for each variable node $v_n$ is set to $L_n$, which is either $L_{noisy,n}$ (for standard BP) or $L_{denoised,n}$ (for the proposed system). After the final iteration, the posterior LLR for each bit is computed, and a hard decision is made.

### 4.3 Undercomplete Convolutional Autoencoder Architecture

The proposed undercomplete convolutional autoencoder is designed to process the sequence of LLRs, treating it as a 1D signal. The architecture aims to learn a compressed representation of the LLRs to filter out noise.

*   **Encoder:** The encoder consists of $L_e$ convolutional layers.
    *   Each layer $l$ has $N_f^{(l)}$ filters (kernels) of size $K_s^{(l)} \times 1$.
    *   Strided convolutions or pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) are used to achieve spatial dimension reduction (undercompleteness). For example, a stride of $S^{(l)} > 1$ in a convolutional layer or a pooling window of $P_s^{(l)}$ with stride $P_{st}^{(l)}$ can be used.
    *   Activation functions, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) or Leaky ReLU, are applied after each convolutional layer, except possibly the final layer of the encoder.
    The output of the encoder is a latent vector $z$ of reduced dimensionality compared to the input LLR vector.

*   **Decoder:** The decoder mirrors the encoder structure to reconstruct the LLR vector. It consists of $L_d$ convolutional (or transposed convolutional) layers.
    *   Transposed convolutional layers (also known as deconvolutional layers) are used to upsample the feature maps, with corresponding filter counts and kernel sizes.
    *   Activation functions are used similarly to the encoder. The final layer of the decoder outputs the denoised LLR vector and typically uses a linear activation function to allow LLRs to take any real value.

*   **Input and Output Dimensions:**
    *   Input: An LLR vector of dimension $N \times 1$, where $N$ is the codeword length.
    *   Output: A denoised LLR vector of dimension $N \times 1$.
    The undercompleteness is achieved by ensuring that the dimensionality of the bottleneck layer (the output of the encoder) is significantly less than $N$. For example, if $N=128$, the bottleneck might be of size $32 \times 1$ or smaller, achieved through appropriate striding/pooling.

*   **Loss Function:** The autoencoder is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the ideal (noise-free) LLRs, $L_{ideal}$, and the autoencoder's output (denoised LLRs), $L_{denoised} = \text{CAE}(L_{noisy})$. The loss function is:
    $L_{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (L_{ideal,i} - L_{denoised,i})^2$
    where $N$ is the length of the LLR vector.

    *(Specific example architecture will be detailed in Section 5, e.g., Number of layers: 3 in encoder, 3 in decoder. Kernels: e.g., 32 filters of size 7x1, 64 filters of size 5x1, 128 filters of size 3x1 for encoder. Strides: e.g., stride 2 in first two conv layers. Activation: LeakyReLU. Bottleneck size: N/4 or N/8).*

### 4.4 Synthetic Training Data Generation

The training data for the CAE consists of pairs of $(L_{noisy}, L_{ideal})$ LLR vectors. This data is generated synthetically as follows:
1.  **Select Parity-Check Matrix (H):** A specific LDPC code is chosen, defined by its parity-check matrix $H$ (e.g., for code lengths $N$ and rates $R$ as specified in Section 5.2).
2.  **Generate Codewords:** A large set of information bit sequences are generated (e.g., all-zero information bits, which, for linear codes, result in an all-zero codeword, or randomly generated information bits encoded into valid codewords $c$). Using the all-zero codeword simplifies the calculation of ideal LLRs, as the ideal LLRs before noise should all be $+\infty$ (or a large positive value in practice for BPSK mapping 0 to +1).
3.  **Modulation:** The chosen codeword (e.g., all-zero codeword $c_0 = (0,0,...,0)$) is BPSK modulated to $s_0 = (+1,+1,...,+1)$.
4.  **Generate Ideal LLRs ($L_{ideal}$):** For the all-zero codeword $s_0$, the "ideal" LLRs before adding noise are effectively infinitely positive for each bit, signifying high confidence in bit '0'. In practice, a large positive constant value (e.g., +5 or +10) can be used as the target $L_{ideal,i}$ for all $i$, or LLRs can be derived from a very high SNR scenario.
5.  **Generate Noisy LLRs ($L_{noisy}$):** To generate $L_{noisy}$ corresponding to $s_0$:
    *   Simulate transmission over the AWGN channel: $y_i = s_{0,i} + n_i = 1 + n_i$, where $n_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
    *   The noise variance $\sigma^2$ is chosen to correspond to a specific channel $E_b/N_0$ value. A range of $E_b/N_0$ values, particularly low SNRs, are used to generate a diverse training set reflecting challenging channel conditions.
    *   Calculate the noisy LLRs: $L_{noisy,i} = \frac{2y_i}{\sigma^2}$.
6.  **Create Training Pairs:** Each pair $(L_{noisy}, L_{ideal})$ forms one training sample. Thousands or millions of such samples are generated using different noise realizations and potentially different $E_b/N_0$ levels to ensure the CAE generalizes well.

### 4.5 Integration of Autoencoder with BP

The integration of the undercomplete convolutional autoencoder into the receiver chain is straightforward:
*   The LLRs are calculated from the received channel symbols as usual.
*   These raw, noisy LLRs ($L_{noisy}$) are then fed as input to the trained CAE.
*   The CAE processes $L_{noisy}$ and outputs the denoised LLRs ($L_{denoised}$).
*   This $L_{denoised}$ vector is then used as the input to the standard BP decoder, replacing the $L_{noisy}$ that would traditionally be used.
The BP decoding algorithm itself remains unchanged. The CAE acts as a dedicated LLR enhancement module.

### 4.6 Training Strategy

The undercomplete convolutional autoencoder is trained offline using the synthetically generated dataset:
*   **Optimizer:** An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, such as Adam [Kingma & Ba, 2014] or RMSprop, is used.
*   **Learning Rate:** A suitable learning rate (e.g., $10^{-3}$ or $10^{-4}$) is chosen, possibly with a learning rate scheduler (e.g., reducing the learning rate on plateau).
*   **Batch Size:** Training is performed using mini-batches of a specified size (e.g., 64, 128, or 256 samples).
*   **Epochs and Stopping Criteria:** The network is trained for a fixed number of epochs or until the performance on a validation set (a subset of training data not used for gradient updates) stops improving for a certain number of epochs (early stopping) to prevent overfitting. The validation loss (MSE) is monitored.
*   **Initialization:** Network weights are initialized using a standard scheme like Xavier or He initialization.
