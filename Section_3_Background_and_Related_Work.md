### 3.1 Belief Propagation

The Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, also known as the sum-product algorithm, is an iterative message-passing algorithm used for performing inference on graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields [4]. In the context of channel coding, BP is widely employed for decoding modern error-correcting codes like Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and Turbo codes, which can achieve performance close to the Shannon limit [2, 5].

The BP algorithm operates on a factor graph representation of the code, which consists of variable nodes (representing the codeword bits) and check nodes (representing the parity-check constraints of the code). The algorithm iteratively passes messages along the edges of this graph. These messages typically represent the probability or log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of a variable node being a particular value (e.g., 0 or 1).

There are two main types of messages:
1.  **Variable-to-Check Messages:** Each variable node sends a message to each connected check node, summarizing the information it has received from other check nodes and its own intrinsic channel-derived information.
2.  **Check-to-Variable Messages:** Each check node sends a message to each connected variable node, indicating the probability of that variable node satisfying the parity-check constraint, based on information from other connected variable nodes.

The process starts with initializing the variable node messages using the LLRs obtained from the communication channel. For an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, the initial LLR for the *i*-th bit, *L(b<sub>i</sub>)*, is calculated as *2y<sub>i</sub>/σ<sup>2</sup>*, where *y<sub>i</sub>* is the received noisy symbol and *σ<sup>2</sup>* is the noise variance.

In each iteration, variable nodes update their messages to check nodes, and then check nodes update their messages to variable nodes. The update rules are derived from the underlying probabilistic model of the code. For example, a check node enforces the constraint that the sum (modulo 2) of its connected variable nodes must be zero. The message it sends to a variable node is calculated based on the messages received from all other connected variable nodes, effectively providing extrinsic information about what the state of that variable node should be to satisfy the constraint.

After a predetermined number of iterations, or when a convergence criterion is met (e.g., all parity checks are satisfied or messages do not change significantly), the algorithm terminates. A final decision on each bit is made by combining the initial channel LLR with the sum of all incoming messages from check nodes to that variable node. If the resulting LLR is positive, the bit is decoded as 0; if negative, it is decoded as 1 (or vice-versa depending on convention).

While BP algorithms are powerful, their performance is sensitive to the quality of the initial LLRs. High noise levels can lead to inaccurate initial beliefs, which can propagate through the iterations and result in decoding errors.

### 3.2 Convolutional Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning, primarily for dimensionality reduction and feature learning [3, 6]. An autoencoder consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder, *f(x)*, maps an input *x* to a lower-dimensional latent representation, *h = f(x)*, often called the hidden representation or bottleneck. The decoder, *g(h)*, then attempts to reconstruct the original input from this latent representation, *x' = g(h)*. The network is trained by minimizing a loss function that measures the dissimilarity between the original input *x* and the reconstructed output *x'*, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) are a specialized type of autoencoder that utilizes convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers, making them particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data, such as images or, in our case, sequences of LLRs which can be treated as 1D signals [7]. The encoder in a CAE typically consists of a series of convolutional layers, often followed by pooling layers (e.g., max pooling or striding convolutions), to progressively reduce the spatial dimensions of the input while increasing the number of feature maps. The decoder mirrors this structure using upsampling layers (e.g., transposed convolutions or unpooling) and convolutional layers to reconstruct the original input dimensions.

A key concept in this research is the *undercomplete* autoencoder. An autoencoder is considered undercomplete if the dimensionality of its latent space *h* is smaller than the dimensionality of the input *x*. This forces the encoder to learn a compressed representation that captures the most salient features or variations in the training data. By learning this compressed representation, undercomplete autoencoders can be effective at noise reduction. If the noise is assumed to be a less salient feature than the underlying signal, the encoder will preferentially capture the signal structure in the latent space, and the decoder will reconstruct a cleaner version of the signal, effectively filtering out some of the noise [8]. The degree of undercompleteness, along with the depth and architecture of the convolutional layers, determines the autoencoder's capacity to model the input data and its noise reduction capabilities.

In the context of denoising LLRs, the CAE is trained with pairs of noisy LLRs (as input) and their corresponding ideal or noise-free LLRs (as the target output). The loss function, typically MSE, penalizes deviations of the autoencoder's output from the ideal LLRs. Through this training, the CAE learns to transform noisy LLR vectors into cleaner, more reliable LLR vectors that can then be used by a subsequent decoder, such as a BP decoder.

### 3.3 Related Work in Machine Learning for Communications

The application of machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance physical layer communications has garnered significant interest in recent years [9, 10]. Researchers have explored ML for various tasks, including channel estimation, channel equalization, signal detection, and channel decoding.

Several studies have investigated the use of autoencoders in communication systems. Some early works proposed end-to-end learning of communication systems using autoencoders, where the encoder and decoder are learned jointly without explicitly defining modulation or coding schemes [O'Shea and Hoydis, 2017]. While promising, these approaches often require retraining for different channel conditions and may not easily integrate with existing standardized components.

More relevant to our work is the application of ML, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), to improve specific components of the receiver, such as the decoder. For instance, neural network-based decoders have been proposed as alternatives to traditional algorithms for certain codes [Nachmani et al., 2016; Lugosch and Gross, 2017]. These often involve unfolding the iterations of existing iterative decoders (like BP) into neural network layers and training them.

The idea of using autoencoders for noise reduction in communication signals or intermediate decoding values has also been explored. For example, [Author, Year] used denoising autoencoders to improve channel estimation. In the context of decoding, some works have focused on post-processing the output of a decoder or improving aspects of iterative decoding. However, the specific approach of using an *undercomplete convolutional autoencoder* as a dedicated pre-processing stage to denoise LLRs *immediately after channel reception* and *before* they enter a standard BP decoder for LDPC or similar codes operating in very noisy AWGN channels (e.g., relevant to deep-space communication) is less explored.

Our work distinguishes itself by:
1.  **Specific Integration Point:** The autoencoder is placed strategically between the channel output (raw LLRs) and the BP decoder input. This aims to provide a cleaner input to the BP algorithm without modifying the BP algorithm itself, allowing for the use of well-established BP decoders.
2.  **Focus on Undercomplete Convolutional Architecture:** We specifically investigate *undercomplete* CAEs, leveraging their inherent capability for learning compact representations to achieve robust noise reduction for LLRs. The convolutional nature is chosen for its suitability in processing sequential LLR data.
3.  **Application Context:** The primary motivation is BER improvement in extremely noisy environments, such as those encountered in long-distance and deep-space communication, where reducing BER is paramount, even at the cost of some added latency.

While other research might touch upon autoencoders for noise reduction or ML in decoding, our combination of an undercomplete CAE applied directly to pre-BP LLR denoising for AWGN channels in a high-noise, BER-critical context represents a focused contribution to this evolving field.
