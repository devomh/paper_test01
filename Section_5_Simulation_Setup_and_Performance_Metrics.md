    * **Simulation Environment:** Describe the software and hardware used for simulations.
    * **Channel Coding Parameters:** Specify the type of channel code used (e.g., LDPC code parameters: code rate, block length). Crucially, state the **small code sizes used for experimentation (e.g., H matrices of dimensions 32x16, 64x32, 126x96)**, clarifying what these dimensions represent in terms of the code structure.
    * **Channel Model Parameters:** Specific values for the **AWGN channel noise (e.g., $E_b/N_0$ range, particularly focusing on low SNR values)** to simulate a very noisy environment.
    * **Autoencoder Training Parameters:** Detailed list of hyperparameters used during autoencoder training.
    * **Performance Metrics:** Define the primary metric as **Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. $E_b/N_0$** or $E_s/N_0$. Acknowledge and state that **decoding latency will likely increase** due to the added autoencoder processing, but that BER reduction is the overriding goal for the target application.
