    * Present the simulation results clearly, typically using BER vs. $E_b/N_0$ plots for the specified code sizes.
    * Compare the performance of the proposed autoencoder-enhanced BP algorithm against the standard BP algorithm (without autoencoder).
    * Analyze the significant impact of the autoencoder on noise reduction and its subsequent effect on BP performance, particularly at **low SNR values**.
    * Discuss the **BER gains achieved** and the conditions under which these gains are most pronounced.
    * Address the **trade-off with increased latency** due to the autoencoder, contextualizing it within the long-distance communication scenario where BER is paramount.
    * Interpret the results and explain why the **undercomplete convolutional autoencoder** proves effective for LLR denoising.
