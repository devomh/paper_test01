Modern communication systems are fundamental to global connectivity, with an ever-increasing demand for reliable data transmission across vast distances and challenging environments. In scenarios such as long-distance or deep-space communication, the need for robust decoding mechanisms becomes paramount due to the severe signal degradation encountered [1]. Channel coding is a critical component in these systems, introducing redundancy into the transmitted data to enable error detection and correction at the receiver, thereby enhancing data integrity. Decoders are then employed to interpret the received noisy signals and recover the original information.

Belief Propagation (BP) algorithms are a class of iterative decoding techniques widely used for various channel codes, including Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, owing to their near-capacity performance in many situations [2]. BP algorithms operate by passing messages (beliefs) between variable nodes and check nodes in a factor graph representing the code. While powerful, the performance of BP decoders can be significantly hampered by high levels of noise in the received Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), particularly at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). This noise sensitivity can lead to a higher Bit Error Rate (BER) and limit the effective operational range of the communication system.

In parallel, machine learning techniques have shown considerable promise in addressing complex signal processing tasks. Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), a type of neural network, are particularly adept at unsupervised feature learning and noise reduction [3]. A CAE consists of an encoder that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the input from this representation. By training the CAE to reconstruct clean signals from noisy inputs, it can learn to effectively suppress noise. An *undercomplete* CAE, where the latent dimension is smaller than the input dimension, forces the network to learn the most salient features of the data, which is beneficial for denoising.

The primary problem addressed in this research is the degradation of BP algorithm performance when operating on LLRs corrupted by significant noise, a common occurrence in communication over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, especially under challenging conditions like those in deep-space links. This degradation manifests as an undesirably high BER.

To address this, we propose the integration of an undercomplete convolutional autoencoder at the receiver. This autoencoder will operate directly on the LLRs after they are received from the AWGN channel but before they are fed into the BP decoder. The autoencoder is specifically designed to mitigate the noise present in these LLRs, thereby providing a cleaner input to the BP algorithm.

The novel contribution of this work lies in the specific application of an *undercomplete convolutional* autoencoder as a pre-processing step for LLR denoising immediately prior to BP decoding. While autoencoders have been explored for various communication tasks, their targeted use in this configuration for enhancing BP performance in very noisy AWGN channels, and the focus on an undercomplete architecture for this specific purpose, represents a distinct approach.

The motivation for this research is driven by the critical need for maximal BER reduction in applications where data integrity is of utmost importance, potentially outweighing concerns about increased processing latency. Interplanetary communication, for instance, demands extremely reliable data transmission, where even minor improvements in BER can have significant scientific or operational impact. The potential increase in latency due to the additional autoencoder processing is acknowledged but considered an acceptable trade-off for the anticipated gains in BER performance.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 3 provides a detailed background on Belief Propagation algorithms and Convolutional Autoencoders, along with a review of related work in machine learning for communications. Section 4 describes the system model and the proposed methodology, including the autoencoder architecture and training data generation. Section 5 outlines the simulation setup and performance metrics used. Section 6 presents and discusses the simulation results. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper, and Section 8 suggests avenues for future research.
